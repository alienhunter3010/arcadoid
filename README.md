### by Alessio Cecchin 4 Arcademy

## Installation

You need python3 and pip3 support

Using venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv arcadenv
source arcadenv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Recommended

Install [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) editor

##### Note

You are free to change the virtual environment name (`arcadenv`, in the example)
but you need to add it on your `.gitignore` file.

```bash
echo my_customized_venv_path >> .gitignore
```

## IDE

[PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains is the recommended IDE.
